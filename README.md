## About The Project

Imagine the world of possibilities by automating an email account. Almost anything you have in mind it could be done by automation. 

Let's say you have a small company and you want to keep your customers engaged with the newest products, at every launch a process could be initialized to trigger a mailing campaign, or even beyond, what about customer survey satisfaction by sending an e-mail after N days after a product purchase?

Perps having tons of scheduled batch processes, receiving an email notification in case of failure?

For this guide you can expect to learn the essentials on how to manage emails with python: 
* Using Object Oriented
* Sending an email
* Attaching files to it
* List received emails
* Explore mailboxes

See, there is not limit when thinking about using mailing automation to improve a given segment.
The limits are that, depending on the process being developed, it is a requirement to study the mailing frequency of it with the intent to avoid spamming other users' accounts, you can't just go out there and develop a process and be triggering emails all the way at any time, respecting threshold is a must.
